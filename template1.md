# Experiment XY

URL: (which ontologies or resources involved?)

## ABox

- examples found in ABox; in Turtle?
- (optional) notes about naming specifics -> naming patterns?

```
Turtle?
```

## TBox

- TBox approximation; in Turtle?
- (optional) notes about linearization

```
Turtle?
```

## SPARQL for detection

- SPARQL queries for detection; probably very similar what is stated in TBox above

```
SPARQL?
```

### Detection Examples in Ontologies

- (optional) Perhaps this will be done later (automatically) within the "Ontology and pattern sampling" phase, but some experiments could also be done before. Or it will extended later here.

## Transformation Pattern

- (optional) Later, there could be a corresponding transformation pattern here or a link to the transformation pattern itself

### LHS (OP1, the source ontology pattern)

- LHS: SPARQL SELECT (with dark triples) 
- (optional) naming detection pattern


### RHS (OP2, the targe ontology pattern)
- RHS Turtle (with dark triples)

### Links
- links between entities in LHS, RHS, resp.
- use explicit links for entities that either persist along the transformation or are derived from one another

#### Naming Transformation Patterns

- considerations about naming patterns, incl. linearization
